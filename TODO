NOTE: Use asyncio.sleep instead of time.sleep

Phases:
    ☐ Step one: Video chat without audio
    ☐ Step two: audio & whiteboarding features
    ☐ Step three: As many classroom tools as we can make

Server:
    ☐ Classroom
        - ClassroomSettings settings
        - Client[] connectedClients
        - int host
        - int port

        ☐ start()
            Starts the server via asyncio
        
        ☐ async register(userData)
            Register a new user with the data they supplied 

            ☐ user specified a name
            ☐ generate userID & send to user
            ☐ add new Client to connectedClients
        
        ☐ async unregister(userID)
            Unregister a disconnected user

            ☐ remove matching Client from connectedClients

        ☐ async ingest(websocket, path)
            Allows users to stream their webcam & audio to their Client

            Format:
                {
                    "userID" : "asdf1234"
                    "frame"  : "frameData"
                }
            
            ☐ Compression needed!
            ☐ Authentication needed
        
        ☐ async run(websocket, path)
            Allow users to view the video of the connected clients

            ☐ register viewer as new
            ☐ unregister viewer when disconnected

            ☐ only view clients currently talking
            ☐ setting to only view main broadcaster

    ☐ Client
        Store information about a connected client
        - isBroadcaster (if the client is a teacher)
        - String name
        - String id
        - websockets.websocket websocket
        - String frame ((base64 string of image) stores the lastest frame streamed to the client)

        ☐ updateFrame(frame)
            updates frame vairable. Should be a functions because we will want to 
            do more things when the frame updates later

Client:
    Appearance:
        ☐ Color scheme?
        ☐ 
    Functionality:
        ☐ Settings dialog that generates a ClassroomSettings object
        ☐ turn Client[] data from server into <img> tags and show videos
    Video:
        ☐ Get Webcam via getUserMedia()
            NOTE: Use jpeg it is MUCH smaller than png

            ☐ allow user to specify dimensions 
            ☐ image compression?
        
        ☐ Connect to stream Websocket & send video
        ☐ Connect to view websocket and get
